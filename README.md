## Brief About Me

I am a recent graduate from the *University of St. Thomas* in Minnesota
where I majored in data analytics with minors in biology and applied
statistics. Currently I’m a graduate student at the *University of
Minnesota’s School of Public Health* where I am studying Public Health
Data Science. I am a native of Minnesota and extremely proud to be from
here, although though if you look at my picture you can see I am quite
Scandinavian.
