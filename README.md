### Hello Everyone! 

I'm Jonathan ðŸ˜„ 

Currently I am finishing my senior year at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota. I will graduate with a B.S. in data analytics specializing in biology, I will also have a minor in applied statistics. I'm hoping to go to graduate school right after graduation to get a MPH. 

This very much is a work in progress and I've been slacking on uploading projects but hopefully soon this will be filled. You can find my linkedin to the left, and eventually I will get around to finishing a notion page where I'd have less code and more about the things I do outside of computers and data. 

The project I'm working on at the moment is with NHANES data from the CDC and looking at trends over the last 10 or so years. I'm going to use this information to push research into obesity and biologically why we continue to see an upward trend despite a stagnation in calorie intake.
